I'm Ziping Liu [![wakatime](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/e012350f-8b4a-4ec4-ae89-56e558bfec5d.svg)](https://wakatime.com/@e012350f-8b4a-4ec4-ae89-56e558bfec5d). I'm an experienced software engineer proficient in full-stack, front-end, back-end, mobile, and DevOps. I excel at creating and maintaining front-end applications with a focus on UI/UX design. Additionally, I develop and train LLMs for integration into software systems.  My background in electrical and computer engineering at UT Austin provided me with a strong foundation in advanced mathematics and hard sciences. The rigorous engineering curriculum emphasized theoretical coursework, fostering a deep understanding of these subjects.
